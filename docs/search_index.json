It is aimed in particular at those studying CORN276 Research Methods and GIS for Zoology, CORN4004 Action Reserch Project and CORN328 Honours Project at Newquay University Centre, but we hope it will be of interest and use to anyone with similar needs. We will touch on every stage of your analysis, from designing the spreadsheet where you will first keep your data, to summarising the data, plotting it and subjecting it to whatever statistical test is appropriate. Finally we will learn how to interpet the output of these tests and then report this in language appropriate for a scientific report. 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.
